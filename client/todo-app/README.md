# Todo App - React Component Files

**Description:**

This document provides an overview of the React component files for a Todo application. It allows users to create, view, manage, and complete tasks effectively.

**Features:**

* User-friendly interface for adding, viewing, and completing todos.
* Dynamic rendering of retrieved and newly added todos.
* Form validation for title and description input.
* Error handling for user feedback and API calls (consider implementing).

**Technologies Used:**

* React
* React Hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect)
* React Router DOM (`createBrowserRouter`, `RouterProvider`)
* Fetch API for making API requests (assuming separate backend API)

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

**Usage:**

1. Start the development server with `npm start`.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to interact with the Todo app.

**Customization and Further Development:**

* Replace placeholder API endpoint URLs in `utils/routing.js` with actual backend API URLs.
* Implement comprehensive error handling for a robust user experience.
* Write unit tests for components to ensure code quality and maintainability.

**Additional Features (Optional):**

* User authentication and authorization
* Todo prioritization
* Due dates for time-sensitive tasks
* CRUD operations for existing todos (read, update, delete)
* Integration with a frontend framework (React or Vue.js) for a polished UI
